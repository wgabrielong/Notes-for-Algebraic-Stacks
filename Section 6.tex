\section{Quotients in Algebraic Spaces}\label{sec: quotients in algebraic spaces}
In the category of affine schemes and $G$ a finite group acting on an affine scheme $\spec A$, the quotient of the affine scheme by the group action is the affine scheme $\spec A^{G}$, where $A^{G}$ is the ring of $G$-invariant elements of $A$. We consider more general quotients using the tools of algebraic spaces.
