\section{Cohomology of Stacks}\label{sec: cohomology of stacks}
We begin with a discussion of pullbacks. Recall that in the category of schemes $\Sch$ (with the Zariski topology), morphisms of schemes are defined as morphisms of locally ringed spaces, in which case the definition of a (topologically) continuous map implies that the preimages of open sets are open. This allows us to compute pushforwards and pullbacks. We seek to define similar properties in the case of stacks.
