\section{Grothendieck Topologies}
Let us recall the following definitions. 
\begin{definition}[Presheaf]\label{def: presheaf on topological space}
    Let $X$ be a topological space. A presheaf of sets $\Fcal$ on $X$ is a functor $(X^{\Opens})^{\Opp}\to\Sets$. 
\end{definition}
A presheaf is a sheaf if it satisfies additional gluing axioms. 
\begin{definition}[Sheaf]\label{def: topological sheaf}
    Let $X$ be a topological space. A sheaf of sets $\Fcal$ on $X$ is a functor $(X^{\Opens})^{\Opp}\to\Sets$ such that the sequence

        \arrow[from=1-1, to=1-3]
        \arrow[shift left, from=1-3, to=1-5]
        \arrow[shift right, from=1-3, to=1-5]
    \end{tikzcd}$$
    is an equalizer for $\{X_{i}\}$ an open cover of $X$.  
\end{definition}
In this way, we say that a sheaf on $X$ is a presheaf on $X$ satisfying descent. Note here that we implicitly used the fact that $X^{\Opens}$ can be naturally endowed with the strucutre of a category with objects open sets of the topological space $X$ and morphisms inclusions of such open sets. This begs the question if we can replace $X^{\Opens}$ with some other category $\Csf$, allowing us to define a sheaf on an arbitrary category $\Csf$. We do this via the construction of a Grothendieck topology by replacing open sets of a topological space with maps into this space. 
\begin{definition}[Grothendieck Topology]\label{def: Grothendieck topology}
    Let $\Csf$ be a category. A Grothendieck topology on $\Csf$ is the data of a set $\{X_{i}\to X\}$ for each object $X\in\Obj(\Csf)$ known as a covering of $X$ such that the following conditions hold:
    \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]
        \item If $Y\to X$ is an isomorphism then $\{Y\to X\}$ is a covering.  
        \item If $\{X_{i}\to X\}$ is a covering and $Y\to X$ any morphism then $\{X_{i}\times_{X}Y\}$ exist and $\{X_{i}\times_{X}Y\to X\}$ is a covering. 
        \item If $\{X_{i}\to X\}$ is a covering and for each $i$ $\{X_{ij}\to X_{i}\}$ is a covering then the composites $\{X_{ij}\to X_{i}\to X\}$ is a covering. 
    \end{enumerate}
\end{definition}
This allows us to define a site. 
\begin{definition}[Site]\label{def: site}
    A site on a category $\Csf$ is the category $\Csf$ endowed with a Grothendieck topology. 
\end{definition}
Let us see some examples.
\begin{example}[Site of a Topological Space]
    Let $X$ be a topological space and $X^{\Opens}$ the category of open sets of $X$ with morphisms inclusions. One can endow $X^{\Opens}$ with a Grothendieck topology by associating to each $U\subseteq X$ open, the set of open covers of $U$. The fiber product is given by intersection of open sets, which agrees with our previous discussion of sheaves and presheaves. 
\end{example}
\begin{example}
    Consider the category of topological spaces $\Top$. The category $\Top$ can be endowed with a Grothendieck topology by taking covers of a topological space $X\in\Obj(\Top)$ to open, continuous, injective maps $X_{i}\to X$. 
\end{example}
\begin{example}[\'{E}tale Site of a Scheme]
    Let $X$ be a scheme. The \'{e}tale site of $X$, denoted $X_{\et}$, is the full subcategory of $\Sch_{X}$ where covers are \'{e}tale morphisms. 
\end{example}
